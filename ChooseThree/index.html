            <cite>When you’re talking about December holidays, you can’t forget Christmas.
Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious
and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year,
it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically
in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries,
is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the
holiday season organized around it.
The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem,
in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable
where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread the word.

Enormously popular in many places, Christmas involves a host of different traditions in the many countries where it’s celebrated. For example:
In Mexico, the celebration of Las Posadas from December 16 to December 24 honors Mary and Joseph’s search for an inn.
Every night, families go to a different home and ask for shelter. Once they’re let in, they celebrate together!
In India, people attend special midnight masses and make kheer, a sweet pudding, for neighbors and family. 
Norwegians celebrate with their own kind of rice pudding, called riskrem, on Christmas Eve.
Brazilian children leave a sock near the window for Bom Velhinho (a Brazilian name for Santa Claus). If he finds it, they get a present!
In Ireland, some people take a cold swim in the ocean on Christmas morning!</cite>
